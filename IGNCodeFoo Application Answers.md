# 1. Introduce Yourself
My name is James Huang and I graduated in December 2020 with a B.E. in Civil Engineering at the Grove School of Engineering at City College of New York. Although my degree is in Civil Engineering, I have always had an interest in computer science and web development. I took C++ and Matlab courses in college, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to pursue a career in the tech industry. As I gradually dove deeper into web development (ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, PostGreSQL), I realized how much I enjoyed coding and how fulfilling it is to create something from scratch. I am currently a part of OSLabs Beta, a nonprofit tech accelerator devoted to furthering high-impact open source software within a collaborative community of dedicated engineers and mentors. I am currently developing a developer tool that visualizes GraphQL query response structures and highlights errors within the response. I am also currently enrolled in an Advanced Software Engineering Immersive Program which is due to end in beginning of June, which leads me to why I am very interested in IGN's Code Foo Program as it starts in mid June! 

As someone who grew up playing Pokemon Fire Red, IGN has been a constant presence in my life. I remember vividly of the times that I would look up walk through's on the IGN website to see how to catch MewTwo and the legendary Beasts. This was actually the inspiration behind my Poke Poll application which I've used for my internship application because I wanted to give back to the community that has helped me so much. In my application, users are able to create an account, log in and vote for their favorite Generation 1 Pokemon. I wanted to embody my application with my love for Pokemon and the nostalgia it brings me through my React Pokemon Card Components that resemble the original Pokemon Cards. I hope that you enjoy using my application as much as I enjoyed making it!

I would love to intern for IGN as I have a passion for games, old and new, and appreciate the value IGN offers to the entertainment community. I believe that my fullstack experience and enthusiasm for entertainment make me a strong candidate for the program. Thank you for considering my application.


# 2. Hisui's New Power Plant
First, I want to understand my list of given information. Currently, we are given the height and weight of a Voltorb. This is not enough information for me to calculate the amount of Voltorbs needed to fully power the village. This means that I will need to obtain certain information in order to solve this problem, which leads me to my next step.

Second, I will need to find out how much power does the village need. This can be dependent on how many buildings or households in the village.

Third, I will need to find out the minimum power a Voltorb is able to produce. With this information, I can divide the 'power that is needed by the Village' by the 'minimum power a Voltorb is able to produce' to get the amount of Voltorbs needed to fully power the village.

Fourth, with every blunt force solution, there lies a more efficient one. Instead of catching multiples of Voltorbs, it is worth considering to instead catch a singlular Zapdos, as it produces more electricity than a Voltorb.
