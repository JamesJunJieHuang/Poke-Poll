# 1. Introduce Yourself
As someone who grew up playing Pokemon Fire Red, IGN has been a constant presence in my life. I remember vividly of the times that I would look up walk through's on the IGN website to see how to catch MewTwo and the legendary Beasts. This was actually the inspiration behind my Poke Poll application which I've used for my internship application because I wanted to give back to the community that has helped me so much. I would love to intern for IGN as I have a passion for games, old and new, and appreciate the value IGN offers to the entertainment community. I believe that my fullstack experience and enthusiasm for entertainment make me a strong candidate for the program. Thank you for considering my application.


# 2. Hisui's New Power Plant
First, I want to understand my list of given information. Currently, we are given the height and weight of a Voltorb. This is not enough information for me to calculate the amount of Voltorbs needed to fully power the village. This means that I will need to obtain certain information in order to solve this problem, which leads me to my next step.

Second, I will need to find out how much power does the village need. This can be dependent on how many buildings or households in the village.

Third, I will need to find out the minimum power a Voltorb is able to produce. With this information, I can divide the 'power that is needed by the Village' by the 'minimum power a Voltorb is able to produce' to get the amount of Voltorbs needed to fully power the village.

Fourth, with every blunt force solution, there lies a more efficient one. Instead of catching multiples of Voltorbs, it is worth considering to instead catch a singlular Zapdos, as it produces more electricity than a Voltorb.
